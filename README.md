This project uses gene expression data to train a machine learning model that predicts whether a breast cancer patient is likely to relapse after treatment. By analyzing high-dimensional transcriptomic profiles, the model aims to uncover molecular signatures of relapse risk,supporting the future of personalized cancer care.
